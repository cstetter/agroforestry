# Tackling climate change: agroforestry adoption in the face of regional weather**

Christian Stetter and Johannes Sauer


## Description

The cultivation of agroforestry systems is regarded as an effective strategy to synergistically mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change in the face of increased occurrences of regional extreme weather events. This study addresses the questions of whether, and under what conditions, farmers are likely to adopt agroforestry and wood-based land-use systems in response to regional weather extremes and presents a novel research approach to tackle this question. A discrete choice experiment was conducted to elicit farmers' preferences for, and willingness to adopt, agroforestry and wood-based land use systems. The results were then combined with geospatial weather information. Assuming adaptive weather expectations, land users' dynamic responses to extreme weather years were simulated in terms of adoption probabilities. Farmers in the case study region in southeastern Germany were found to have a negative preference for alley-cropping systems (i.e. agroforestry) and short rotation coppice, compared to an exclusively crop-based land use system. However, the results from the simulation of a 2018-like extreme weather year showed that alley-cropping might have a very high probability of being adopted in the medium to long-term under different circumstances, thus enhancing farmers' resilience to climate change.
